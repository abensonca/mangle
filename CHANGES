mangle1.4.2
4 Mar 2005
Molly Swanson

Added pixelization functions to speed up snap, balkanize, unify, and polyid.
New command: pixelize
New functions: get_pixel, which_pixel, get_child_pixels, get_parent_pixels, 
get_res, pixel_list, pixel_start, poly_sort
Modified polygon format to include pixel number
Made a variety of other small, minor changes

mangle1.4.1
30 Sep 2004

Many thanks to Michael Blanton, who is working on the SDSS mask,
for bringing these two problems to light.

1. In some cases, balkanize creates long, extremely thin polygons that mangle
cannot subsequently deal with, because the polygons are simply too thin for
the numerics.  The solution is to add to the balkanization routine a
penultimate step that snaps the edges of each polygon to each other.
This is not a bad idea anyway, since polygons produced by balkanization
should never need additional snapping.

2. Connected with the above problem, in some cases and on some platforms
vmid fails to find a midpoint of a polygon.  The problematic polygons
are precisely the long extremely thin polygons mentioned in 1.
In these cases the barycentre of the polygon provides a satisfactory midpoint.
Therefore the barycentre is now included as one of the points to test
as a possible midpoint of a polygon.

In addition to the above, I added "intrinsic" declarations of abs max and min
to the fortran routines that use those functions, as required by some
fortran compilers.

mangle1.4
3 Sep 2003

Several minor improvements.
The mangle code has gotten a pretty good workout on the 2dF 230k sample,
released on 30 June 2003, and there have been no changes in mangle for about
a month now, so I'm getting pretty happy that the code has converged,
at least for the time being.

In the future, if demand warrants, there may be an accelerated version of
mangle that replaces double do loops over polygons with code that is a little
more intelligent about deciding whether 2 polygons are close to each other.
