At the command line, type
2df100k
and find out what happens.

You should be aware that Intel and Sun chips have different endianness.
If your system is having a problem reading unformatted fortran files
maglim.ngp.dat
maglim.ran.dat
maglim.sgp.dat
mask.ngp.dat
mask.ran.dat
mask.sgp.dat
it's probably an endianness problem.
Read HELP.unformatted in the mangle directory.

Alternatively, you can use the formatted versions of these files
maglim.ngp.dat.fmt
maglim.ran.dat.fmt
maglim.sgp.dat.fmt
mask.ngp.dat.fmt
mask.ran.dat.fmt
mask.sgp.dat.fmt
which are available in the "masks" section of the mangle website.
