The mangle software is written in c and fortran,
so to compile mangle you will need both c and fortran compilers.

To (re)compile
--------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make

The executables will be in
<mangle_directory>/bin

To remove unneeded object files
-------------------------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make clean

To remove a previous compilation and compile from scratch
---------------------------------------------------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make cleanest
make

To patch mangle1.4 to mangle1.4.1
---------------------------------
cd <mangle_directory>
patch -p1 < ../path.to.the/mangle1.4_to_1.4.1.patch

You will then need to recompile.

Systems on which mangle has compiled successfully
-------------------------------------------------

Linux
gcc versions 2, 3 or 4
gfortran xxx or later for 80-bit version
g77 or fort77 for 64-bit version

Mac OSX
gcc
gfortran
see http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries for gfortran for Mac OSX
may require updated version of cctools from ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/

Solaris
cc or gcc
f77 or g77

Troubleshooting
---------------
If the Makefile gives problems, try using gmake (the gnu version of make)
in place of make.  More generally, mangle is known to compile and run
successfully with the gnu versions gcc and g77 of the c and fortran compilers,
and with the gnu version gmake of the make command.
To compile the 80 bit version, you will need a compiler that supports real*10,
for example, gfortran version xxx or later.


There are bound to be problems with compilation in early stages of the general
release of mangle, since mangle has been tested only on a limited number of
systems.  If you are having problems compiling, please contact the mangle development team via Andrew.Hamilton@colorado.edu or tegmark@mit.edu, and we will try to work with you to get mangle to compile on your system.
