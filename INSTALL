The mangle software is written in c and fortran 77,
so to compile mangle you will need both c and f77 compilers.

To patch mangle1.4 to mangle1.4.1
---------------------------------
cd <mangle_directory>
patch -p1 < ../path.to.the/mangle1.4_to_1.4.1.patch

You will then need to recompile.

To (re)compile
--------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make

The executables will be in
<mangle_directory>/bin

To remove unneeded object files
-------------------------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make clean

To remove a previous compilation and compile from scratch
---------------------------------------------------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make cleanest
make

Systems on which mangle has compiled successfully
-------------------------------------------------

Linux
gcc versions 2 or 3
g77 or fort77

Solaris
cc or gcc
f77 or g77

Troubleshooting
---------------
If the Makefile gives problems, try using gmake (the gnu version of make)
in place of make.  More generally, mangle is known to compile and run
successfully with the gnu versions gcc and g77 of the c and fortran compilers,
and with the gnu version gmake of the make command.

There are bound to be problems with compilation in early stages of the general
release of mangle, since mangle has been tested only on a limited number of
systems.  If you are having problems compiling, please email me
Andrew.Hamilton@colorado.edu, and I will try to work with you to get mangle
to compile on your system.
